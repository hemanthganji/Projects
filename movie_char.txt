Since this is an original story, I can create characters that fit the narrative. Here are some movie-style characters for the story:

1. **Kiran** – The young, curious protagonist who discovers the magical realm. He is brave, kind-hearted, and grows into a hero through his adventures.

2. **Elda** – A wise, mystical elf who guides Kiran in understanding the powers of the glowing stone. She becomes his mentor and friend.

3. **Aero** – A mischievous but loyal sprite who often provides comic relief. Despite his playful nature, Aero is a powerful ally when Kiran needs him most.

4. **Malvor** – The dark sorcerer threatening the magical realm with his army of shadow creatures. His goal is to harness the stone's power for evil.

5. **Nysa** – A warrior princess from the magical realm, skilled with a bow and deeply committed to protecting her land. She becomes one of Kiran’s closest allies.

6. **Tiber** – The talking owl who serves as Kiran’s guide between the human world and the magical realm. His wisdom is invaluable throughout the journey.

7. **Evanor** – A giant, gentle creature who helps Kiran by using his immense strength to defeat enemies and clear paths on their journey.

8. **Zara** – The Queen of the magical realm, a regal and powerful ruler who entrusts Kiran with the stone to save her land.

9. **Fera** – A cunning fox spirit who initially deceives Kiran but later becomes an ally, offering strategic help to outwit Malvor.

10. **Lyra** – Kiran’s sister in the village, who unknowingly has a connection to the magical realm and plays a pivotal role in the sequel.

These characters could help flesh out the world and give the story a rich, cinematic feel!
